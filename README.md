User Activity Plus (Question2Answer plugin)
=================================================

This is a page plugin for popular open source Q&A platform, [Question2Answer](http://www.question2answer.org). It adds the functionality to show every question and answer of a user.

The posts list is paginated and uses the value set under Admin > Lists > Questions page length (default 20). Answers use a similar design to question lists but also shows a snippet of the answer. Both lists include the class `qa-a-count-selected` where applicable for appropriate styling of selected answers.



Installation & Usage
-------------------------------------------------

1. Download and extract the files to a subfolder such as `user-activity-plus` inside the `qa-plugins` folder of your Q2A installation.

2. Copy the styles from sample.css to your theme's stylesheet.

3. Now on a user's profile are links to see all questions and answers of the user. They are show both in the activity stats table and below the "Recent Activity" question list.
